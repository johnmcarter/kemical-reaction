  <div style="text-align: left;">Kemical Reaction was formed in
    October of 2011 by 3 friends who wanted to create a Christmas CD. It
    eventually grew to be a professional band. The name "Kemical Reaction"
    was thought of during a science class. The members of the group are
    Nick (Lead/Backing Vocals, Bass), John (Lead Vocals, Rhythm/Lead Guitar), Sean (Lead
    Guitar), and Dylan (Drums).
    <br> <br>
    To date, we have appeared live three times,
    including our very own concerts which were held on June 9, 2012 and June 8, 2013.&nbsp; We
    have also made guest appearances at the following: a Christmas banquet,
    on December 21, 2012, the "BRS Idol" held at our school on March 11,
    2013, and "Pslam 150 Night" at Immanuel Baptist Church in April of 2013.
    <br> <br>
    Some musical acts that influenced us are Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Creedence Clearwater Revival.
    The genres that influenced us are Gospel, Rock 'n' Roll,
    Pop, and Rhythm and Blues. We have released one single to date, Elvis
    Presley's "That's Alright, Mama", in May of 2012.
